     * to Ext.Component being called thereafter. This makes it easy to implement and, if needed, override the constructor
     * logic of the Component at any step in the hierarchy.
     * The initComponent method must contain a call to callParent in order to ensure that the parent class'
     * initComponent method is also called.
     * All config options passed to the constructor are applied to this before initComponent is called, so you
     * can simply access them with this.someOption.
