### Installation via Git

Follow the instruction below if you want to install Shopware using Git.

1.) Clone the git repository to the desired location using:

    git clone https://github.com/shopware/shopware.git
    cd shopware
    git checkout labs

In case you wish to contribute to Shopware, fork the `labs` branch rather than cloning it, and create a pull request via Github. For further information please read the section "Get involved" of this document.

In case you want to use our docker image just type the following commands:
```yaml
./psh.phar docker:start

./psh.phar docker:ssh

./psh.phar init
```

Now your shop is available under the following url: http://10.101.101.56

If you don't want to use docker, please follow the next steps:

2.) Set the correct directory permissions:

    chmod -R 755 var
    chmod -R 755 web
    chmod -R 755 custom/plugins

Depending on your server configuration, it might be necessary to set whole write permissions (777) to the files and folders above.
You can also start testing with lower permissions due to security reasons (644 for example) as long as your php process can write to those files.

3.) Copy the .psh.yaml.dist file to .psh.yaml.override and delete everything what is not part of the const section. Your override file should look like this:
```yaml
const:
  DB_USER: "app"
  DB_PASSWORD: "app"
  DB_HOST: "localhost"
  DB_NAME: "shopware"
  DB_PORT: "3306"
  SW_HOST: "your-shop.com"  
  SW_BASE_PATH: ""
  PHP_VERSION: "7.1"
``` 
Please replace the provided credentials with your own. After that you can provision your installation via psh.phar:
```bash
./psh.phar init
```

You can now access your shop. If you want to install Shopware in a sub directory, please fill out the setting `SW_BASE PATH` with your installation path e.g. for example `/sub/direcory`. If you're seeing an Apache directory listing, then you have to modify your `SW_BASE_PATH` and append `/web` to the given path. Please keep in mind that you have to re-run `./psh.phar init` when you're modifying your `.psh.yaml.override` file.

# Administration

- **Requirements:**
    - Node.js > 8.x
    - NPM > 5.x

After initializing the application itself using `./psh.phar init` the stack is up and running. The backend is like a separate application with its own dependencies. Therefore we create a commands for your convince to set it up as well:

```bash
./psh.phar administration:init
```

This will resolve the Node.js dependencies of the backend. If you're having trouble setting resolving the using `psh`, go to the `src/Administration/Resources/administration` directory and run `npm install` / `yarn` in the folder to resolve the dependencies manually.

Now you're having two ways to go. If you just want to have a working copy of the backend you have to build the project:

```bash
./psh.phar administration:build
```

Now you can access the complied version of the backend using `<http://your-shop-url/admin>`.

If you want to start developing with the backend we're highly recommend the hot module reloading mode. In this mode we're spawning a custom Node.js webserver which is using the `webpack-devserver`:

```bash
./psh.phar administration:watch
```

The hot module reloading mode enables you to use the [Vue.js DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd) as well as having hot module reloading in place for your components.
